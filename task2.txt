Objects and its internal representation in Javascript:-

All JavaScript values, except primitives, are objects.
**A primitive value is a value that has no properties or methods.**

Objects are defined by using curly braces {} to define key-value pairs separated by commas.
const person = {
  name: "Dheena Dayalan",
  age: 22,
  occupation: "Software Engineer"
}

Properties and Values:
Properties: 
  These are the named attributes of an object. They act like unique identifiers for the data you store. 
  Property names can be strings or symbols.
Values: 
  These are the actual data you store within the object. Values can be any data type â€“ numbers, strings, 
  booleans, arrays, even other objects!

It helps in:-
  # Objects help group related data together, making your code more readable and maintainable.
  # Objects can hold various data types, allowing you to store complex information.
  # You can create objects with common properties and functionality, making your code more modular and reusable.
